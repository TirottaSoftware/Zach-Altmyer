            The excitement of adding a new product to your inventory can quickly
            be overshadowed by the worry of exactly what price you should set
            your products at.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Overprice, and you may price yourself out of the market and therefore
          won’t make any sales. Underprice, and your target audience may
          consider your product too cheap to be good quality – and so you still
          won’t make any sales. At the other extreme, you may make plenty of
          sales but a dismal profit which will not sustain your business!
        </p>
        <p>
          Pricing your products is all about
          <b>striking a balance</b>, but of course, that’s often easier said
          than done. Understanding how to price your products is the foundation
          from which your business will prosper.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no magic formula to pricing your products because this will
          depend on several factors:
        </p>
        <ul class="bold">
          <li>Your product</li>
          <li>Your production costs and business expenses</li>
          <li>Your target market</li>
          <li>Your revenue goals</li>
          <li>Your competitors’ price-points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every business will have a different set of answers to these key
          factors, but even then, how to price your products doesn’t just come
          down to the numbers. In fact, number-crunching is likely to be the
          easiest part of the whole process. It’s actually very straightforward
          to work out the price of your product in theory because it’s a very
          simple equation based on your desired
          <a href="#" class="link">profit margin</a> (your selling price minus
          your costs):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How much profit do you want to make? Let’s say $5 per unit sold
          </li>
          <li>
            What are your total product costs and expenses? Let’s say $20 per
            unit.
          </li>
          <li>Break-even selling price: $20 (your total outlay)</li>
          <li>Selling cost to make $5 profit per unit: $25</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You must realise that the price of your product is what will sustain
          your business and so a decent profit is essential. If you’re running
          at a loss or only ‘turning money’ (breaking even), then scaling your
          business is going to be a long and challenging road.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in theory, you will price your product taking into account your
          desired profit. But, how do you know that you will be able to price
          your product at, for example, $25 and it will sell at that price-point
          without difficulty?
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t. Not without considering all the other factors involved when
          you decide how to price your products.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before you decide on your product
          <a href="#" class="link">pricing strategy</a> – and there are a few –
          there’s one super important point you must look at as a priority using
          information that is easily accessible to you for free.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/img/blog/01-A.jpg" alt="" />
        <h1>How to Price Your Products: 3 Things to Consider</h1>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>Know Where the Market is Heading</h3></li>
          <p>
            Do you regularly look up industry news, read white papers, keep
            track of market trends and the introduction of new or improved
            products? If you don’t, how will you spot patterns that may impact
            the demand or future sales of your product – and ultimately your
            pricing?
          </p>
          <p>
            A change in the market is one of the main factors which is likely to
            prompt you into making a price tweak. For example, if your product
            is seasonal, such as summer clothing, one lousy season weatherwise
            will influence sales – and prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re in the beauty niche and a specific ingredient or product
            is re-regulated, you may have a limited period to sell the current
            stock.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your product is not environmentally friendly, you may have to
            make modifications to the price to appeal to the ever-evolving needs
            of the eco-conscious public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Factors will always vary considerably from niche to niche, so it’s
            vital to be on the ball and
            <b>
              make changes to your prices based on informed decisions derived
              from current market trends.
            </b>
          </p>
          <li><h3>Monitor Your Prices</h3></li>
          <p>
            Not only should you be monitoring the market and know where it’s
            heading, but also your product prices on an individual basis. In
            other words, singularly, are each of your products profitable? This
            is different from looking at your profitability as a business as a
            whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that your revenue goal – which is part of how you decide on
            your profit – should be contributed to by all products, not just one
            or two best sellers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monitoring your competitors’ prices is the easiest way to stay
            informed of price fluctuations which will in turn help you work out
            how to price your products. You don’t have to eye-ball them every
            day but making some necessary checks once a week is enough for you
            to catch any significant price changes and to investigate the
            reasons behind them.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also
            <b>get feedback on your pricing from your customers regularly</b>.
            Send an email, invite them to a poll or survey in exchange for a
            voucher or other incentive. Your real customers’ opinions count as
            they have already invested in your product. The bonus is that in
            doing this, you will also be proving that you actually care about
            your business, your reputation and your customers.
          </p>
          <li><h3>Raise Your Prices Regularly</h3></li>
          <p>
            So, let’s assume that you have set your pricing, you’re keeping
            abreast of your competitors, are aware of any new to market products
            and your product is selling at a steady rate.
          </p>
          <p>Should you raise your price – or is that a risky move?</p>
          <p>
            The straight answer is that you should never be afraid to test new
            prices, offers or combinations (such as bundles – more on that
            shortly) that will potentially help you sell more products and
            ultimately increase your profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is likely to come a period in your business that you will need
            to raise your prices anyway because if you don’t, you are not
            managing your business with any real thought for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, raise your price and test new offers every month and monitor any
            uptake or slow down in orders generated. You’ll see a reaction
            pretty quickly either way, but it’s worth noting that you’ll find
            price increases are accepted more readily in good economic times!
            What’s really interesting is that if you see your competitors
            increasing their prices in line with yours you know you’ve made a
            positive change that works!
          </p>
          <p>
            If a particular price or offer doesn’t work – don’t panic, just try
            something new. Continually testing and monitoring is essential so
            that you remain competitive within your niche – but you also make
            the profit you deserve.
          </p>
        </ol>
        <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
          Understanding your market and then testing that market is the key to
          learning how to price your products to enable the growth of a
          sustainable business. By pricing your products thoughtfully and
          regularly tweaking, you’ll uncover the price that converts the best.
          Optimal returns can then be achieved by continual monitoring.
